1. Process Failure Detectors 
Is it possible to implement either a reliable or an unreliable process failure detector using an unreliable communication channel? Explain your answer.
Ans.

2. DNS Navigation

b) What is the relevance of the recursive navigation option to concurrency within a name server?

4. Chord Peer-to-Peer System 
Consider the Chord peer-to-peer system where identifiers are 8-bit numbers (0–255). The system currently has nodes with the following identifiers:
9, 10, 20, 24, 90, 105, 245.
a) List all the fingers at node 9. (Show work.)
b) Suppose node 9 needs to locate the node responsible for the key with identifier 242. Show how the request will be forwarded step by step until it reaches the correct node.
Ans.


5. Chord Key Placement
In the Chord network above, determine which node is responsible for storing each of the following keys:
9, 10, 11, 29, 248, 255.
Ans.
